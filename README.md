# Chromatic Adaptation and Color Transfer

## Description

The directory contains 2 folders, one with the Python code used (1 launch window and 2 widgets) and the other with the .exe version of the code. These tools use the principle of color transfer and chromatic adaptation.

### 1. Chromatic Adaptation

The chromatic_adaptation script performs chromatic adaptation on an input image to match a target color. It calculates the mean of each channel in the image and adapts the colors accordingly to achieve the desired target color.

### 2. Color Transfer
The color transfer script transfers colors from a source image to a target image. It calculates the mean and standard deviation of each channel in both images and applies color transfer to match the color distribution of the source image to the target image.
